# Australian Record Stores
## A record store listing web application

v1.1

Australian Record Stores is a listing site which allows users to upload records on record stores based around Australia. Registered users can create a new record store and add images. Only authors of stores can edit them. Any registered users can leave reviews along with editing and deleting their own reviews.

I built this project using the EJS template engine and NodeJS/Express to dynamically update and retrieve information from the database. MongoDB is the database used on this application. Bootstrap has been used as the CSS framework on this application.

The live project can be viewed [here](https://ozrecordstore.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, EJS, Node, Express, MongoDB, PassportJS, MapBox API

### Test login user details
I've set up a test user account so users can add and edit recordstores, along with adding and removing reviews that have been left by the user.
