# Record Store

This is a web application which allows users to upload information about Australian record stores. Users can register, login, create record store listings and add reviews. Authentication has been added so only author can edit listings. Users can also only edit and delete their own reviews. The project incorporates full CRUD functionality. 

The live project can be viewed [here](https://ozrecordstore.herokuapp.com/)

## Login 
I've set up a test user account so users can add and edit recordstores, along with adding and removing reviews that have been left by the user.

Username: testuser
Password: test1234

## Technologies
This app was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node, Express and MongoDB. It also incorporates validations using PassportJS. The MapBox API is used to show record store locations and cluster maps.

I built this project as part of online bootcamp I was studying.
